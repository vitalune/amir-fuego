<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web document that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going.

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our purposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print."

You could make this document the easy way by posting on Google Site, an Adobe Spark, a Weebly, or a Wix, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will also learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science...enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management.

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?-->

 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assets like images, pdf's, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the index.html and style.css files in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to explain to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->
<title>fuego</title>
<!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--The link rel(ationship) connects the HTML to the cascading style sheet or CSS file. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating to font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
  <!--We've added Google Fonts to The Webtext Generator. Go to https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_google_fonts.asp to find fonts and add them to this stylesheet link and to the html selector on style.css-->

<!--The <body> of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
<body>

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a symbolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Fuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<div class="hero-image">
  <div class="hero-text">
<!--Next, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not "John en Fuego" or not majoring in "electracy"-->

<!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes...improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->

<div class="text-block">
  <h2>Field or Career</h2>

  <p>Computer Science combines logical thinking, creativity, and innovation to solve real-world problems. As a biomedical AI engineer intern, I focus on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Building local AI models, especially Large Language Models</li>
    <li>Democratizing access to intelligent systems</li>
    <li>Revolutionizing healthcare through accessible diagnostic tools</li>
    <li>Creating personalized treatment solutions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Every line of code contributes to technology serving humanity's greatest challenges.</p>
</div>

<!--Replace the image here. Control image width using inline styling. Adjust "frame" class properties using CSS.)-->

  <img class="frame" src="feet1.jpeg" width="50%" alt="Managing a team of AI agents with Claude Code">
    <div class="caption">
      <p><i>Precision and focus - essential qualities in programming and AI development</i></p>

<!--in this next section you will explain a little more about your family (what does family means to you? Who are the people that influenced you on this path? Who are the folks with whom you now stand?).-->

<div class="text-block">
  <h2>Family and Home</h2>

<!--Now is the time to think about privacy! If you have concerns, you can always use stock images, or get creative in myriad other ways. Add images to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace the names in the grid code below. Remember file names and formats are case sensitive! You can add more images if you wish, or subtract...you might also need to move content around to achieve balance. See what happens – sometimes you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. Since these images are smaller, you will want to resize your images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time and thus general accessibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--A photo grid uses rows and column classes to create some divisions on the page that will scale with mobile devices. The style.css page provides other attributes that will adjust the image depending on the size of screens.-->


  <div class="flexbox-container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <img src="pgrid1.jpeg" alt="Family moments that shaped my journey into technology">

        </div>
    </div>
        <p><i>Family and home - the foundation that supports my journey in computer science and AI innovation.</i></p>
  </div>

<!--Time to write. Flesh it out! Define family, qualify it, explicate it telling us why these people are important, and how they contributed to how you got here and where you are going. What about "home." What  does that mean to you? In what ways is it significant in determining where your are going? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that says "Lorem ipsum."-->

<div class="text-block">
  <p>Family extends beyond blood relations to include the minds that shaped my technical passion. My home environment fostered:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A culture of questioning and experimentation</li>
    <li>Encouragement to tinker and understand how things work</li>
    <li>Never-ending curiosity about "why" and "how"</li>
    <li>Confidence to tackle complex AI challenges</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Key lesson learned: The most powerful algorithms are often the simplest ones, and true innovation requires understanding both human needs and technical precision.</p>
</div>


<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

<div class="text-block">
  <h2>Entertainment</h2>

<!--find a YouTube video that has some significance in your life. Click "share," and copy and paste the embed link and paste it below-->

</div>
    <p>Technical tutorials and AI research videos that inspire my approach to building local language models and understanding machine learning concepts.</p>


<!--Time to process. How do you use media? What role do certain kinds of media play in your life? How does media serve a social function? In what way might you be "recreating" or "remaking" media in your everyday life?

FUN FACT: "Lorem ipsum", "Lorem ipsum" was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum," developers made it non-sensical. So while you will probably never write as well as Cicero, you can always improve upon "Lorem ipsum." -->

  <p>Media shapes my understanding of technology as both tool and creative medium. My daily digital diet includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>YouTube tutorials and AI research videos</li>
    <li>GitHub repositories and technical blogs</li>
    <li>Machine learning papers and programming guides</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I constantly "remix" these influences, creating my own implementations and testing ideas about AI accessibility. My media consumption mirrors my coding philosophy: everything is modular, improvable, and most innovations happen at intersections.</p>
</div>

<!--Between these divisions, you may want to add a new div element like an image (see the bottom of this html page for instructions) -->

<!--We will use this next section to process your community(-ies)-->

<div class="text-block">
  <h2>Community</h2>

<!--So what exactly is your community: is it actual? virtual? Where do find your ground, or at least, where do you drop anchor, you drifter, you? While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->
<div>
<img src="feet2.JPG" alt="Group photo on a Corolla, NC rooftop." class="center-img" style="width:100%;">
</div>

  <p>My community spans multiple dimensions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Local biomedical research team (internship)</li>
    <li>Global open-source AI community on GitHub</li>
    <li>Virtual developer spaces and 2 AM breakthrough sharing</li>
    <li>Stack Overflow problem-solving threads</li>
    <li>Discord servers debating AI ethics</li>
    <li>University labs fostering interdisciplinary thinking</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My anchoring values: open collaboration, responsible innovation, and ensuring powerful tools are accessible to all, not just those with deep pockets.</p>
  </div>

<!--Like it or not, your schooling, formal and informal, for better or for worse, has been another factor that has brought you here and prepared you for this moment. Let's think through these systems, expectations, and outcomes. And let's also think a little about futurity... where is this learning, formal and informal – this unconcealing – taking you? -->

<!--Discuss the role schooling has played in our lives. -->
<div class="text-block">
  <h2>School</h2>
  <p>Formal schooling provided structured foundations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Algorithms, data structures, mathematical proofs</li>
    <li>Systematic thinking through CS coursework</li>
    <li>Understanding human stakes through biomedical research</li>
    <li>Learning to question "how," "why," and "for whom"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Key insight: Expertise isn't knowing all answers—it's asking better questions and embracing uncertainty. This education leads toward bridging AI research with healthcare applications where technology serves human flourishing.</p>
  </div>

<!--I'd like to know your thoughts on AI and perhaps technology in general, and what it means for you and your life moving forward. This is also a great place to do some vibe coding if you so desire. How do you vibe code? Why shoudld you vibe code? This is something you must begin to discover.-->

<div class="text-block">
<h2>Me, technology, AI, and futures</h2>
  <p>AI represents tremendous possibility and profound responsibility. My focus on building local LLMs aims to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Democratize access to intelligent tools</li>
    <li>Level playing fields in education, healthcare, and creativity</li>
    <li>Remove dependence on corporate gatekeepers</li>
    <li>Enable AI systems to run on local hardware</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When I "vibe code," I prototype futures where human creativity and AI augment each other. My guiding questions: Who benefits? Who is excluded? How can we do better?</p>
  <p>The code I write today votes for technology that amplifies human agency and serves communities beyond Silicon Valley.</p>

<!--The final step in our process will be to ensure that a smaller version of our "hero image," what Ulmer would refer to as our "wide image," repeats at the bottom of our document to better reinforce this motif.  -->
